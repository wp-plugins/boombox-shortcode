Embed your Boombox.com content on your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Embed your [Boombox](http://www.boombox.com) content on your WordPress site. Allows the use of a special short code `[boombox]` for embedding Boombox content.

[Boombox](http://www.boombox.com) + Boombox Shortcode Plugin = **WordPress lovin’.**

[Boombox](http://www.boombox.com) is the world’s simplest tool for creating quizzes, polls and other forms of interactive content. It lets everyone from Fortune 500 companies to your mother create interactive content and share it with the world. With our WordPress plugin, anyone who creates their own content on WordPress can now create and embed their own quizzes, polls, etc just like BuzzFeed. That means you can use our tool to promote your own site or blog without people ever leaving your site.

You could embed Boombox content on WordPress before, but the process was complicated and didn’t work for all types of users on WordPress. We wanted to simplify the process, so we created the **Boombox Shortcode Plugin** and made it available for all our faithful WordPress users. You create a quiz on Boombox, grab the WordPress shortcode and with the plugin installed on your WordPress site, just paste it into any post or page on WordPress and that’s it. Your interactive widget will embed itself on your site and like embedding a video from YouTube or Vimeo, your quiz will appear inline with your content.

Don't have a Boombox account? No problem! Head over to [Boombox.com](http://www.boombox.com) and sign up for an account, and start making your own quizzes and polls.

= Current Features =

* Enables use the Boombox Shortcode instead of the full Boombox embed code.
* Embed Boombox widgets as any type of user instead of just Editors and Admins


= Example: =
`[boombox widget="poll" id="123" width="100%" height="auto"]`

For old school manual installation people:

1. copy the folder `boombox-shortcode` into the `/wp-content/plugins/` folder.
2. Then go to the Plugins area of the Admin and activate.

Otherwise:

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Boombox? =

[Boombox](http://www.boombox.com) is a web app that helps anybody build beautiful, engaging, interactive content like polls and quizzes. It's great for driving social traffic, generating qualified leads, and presenting targeted offers. [Learn more about Boombox](http://www.boombox.com).


= Why is this plugin useful? =

Shortcodes are cleaner and simpler! Only Editors and Admins can copy and paste the javascript embed code to embed a Boombox quiz onto a WordPress page, authors cannot.

With embed codes you need to make sure to be in the "Text" tab of the writing area. If a user is in the "Visual" (default) tab, the embed code will not work. Short codes will always work in either text editor.

= But wait! I already have a quiz using the old embed code! Will it still work on WordPress? =

Fear no more! Your quiz will continue to function with no problem. Heck, if you want to keep using the old method for future quizzes, that’s fine. We just created the shortcode, like was said before, because it’s cleaner and simpler.


= Is it difficult to install and get setup? =

Nope, it’s easy. Check out the Installation section to see just how easy it is.

= What do all the parameters in the code mean? =

* widget: The type of Boombox widget that you are embedding. (Valid values are "quiz" or "poll")* id: The id of your quiz. (Valid values are your widget id "K8nVuVy0ltLiSsJ85C6vzAVpIPh")
* width: The pixel or percentage width of your quiz container. ("500px" or "100%" - Default: "100%")
* height: The pixel or percentage width of your quiz container. Setting this to auto will resize the quiz on each question to match the content. ("500px", "100%", "auto" - Default: "auto")


Now if that was over your head, no need to worry about it. Just install the plugin, copy the shortcode from Boombox after creating the quiz and paste it into WordPress and your quiz will look great!
