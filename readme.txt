Boombox helps serious publishers, brands and agencies create stunning interactive content (quizzes, polls, etc) and drive engagement.

== Description ==

Embed your [Boombox](http://www.boombox.com) content on your WordPress site. Allows the use of a special short code `[boombox]` for embedding Boombox content.

[Boombox](http://www.boombox.com) is the world’s simplest tool for creating quizzes, polls, and other forms of interactive content. It makes it easy for everyone from Fortune 500 companies to bloggers to create engaging content and share it with the world. Now with our WordPress plugin, anyone using WordPress can create and embed quizzes and polls. That means you can use Boombox to showcase the interactive content you create without ever asking visitors to leave your site

You could embed Boombox content on WordPress before, but the process was more complicated and didn’t work for everyone. We’ve simplified things and created the Boombox Shortcode Plugin. With it, you create interactive content (like quizzes and polls) on Boombox and grab the WordPress shortcode. Then, with the plugin installed on your site, you can paste that shortcode into any post or page. That’s it! Your interactive content will appear on your site, and it will appear inline with your content, just like when you embed a video from YouTube or Vimeo.

Don't have a Boombox account? No problem. Head over to [Boombox.com](http://www.boombox.com), sign up for an account, and start making stunning interactive content.

= Why is this plugin useful? =

Shortcodes are cleaner and simpler than javascript embed code. In WordPress, only Editors and Admins can copy and paste the javascript code to embed a Boombox quiz, but authors cannot.


= I have a quiz/poll using the old embed code. Will it still work on WordPress? =

Of course! Your content will be the same as before. In fact, if you want to continue using the old method for future quizzes and polls without the plugin, that works too.


= Is it difficult to install and get setup? =

Not at all - it’s two steps. Take a look at the ‘Installation’ section to see just how easy it is.

= What do all the parameters in the code mean? =

Boombox does all the hard stuff for you - no need to worry about what the code means. But if you’re genuinely curious, here it is:

* widget: the type of Boombox widget that you are embedding. (Valid values are "quiz" or "poll")
* id: the id of your quiz/poll. (Valid values are your widget id "K8nVuVy0ltLiSsJ85C6vzAVpIPh")
* width: the pixel or percentage width of your quiz/poll container. ("500px" or "100%" - Default: "100%")
* height: The pixel or percentage width of your quiz/poll container. Setting this to auto will resize the quiz/poll on each question to match the content. ("500px", "100%", "auto" - Default: "auto")
